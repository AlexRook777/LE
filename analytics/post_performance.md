# Post Performance

Track per-post metrics to identify what works and what doesn't.

## Format

## Key Metrics

- **Impressions** — how many people saw the post
- **Likes** — engagement signal
- **Comments** — strongest engagement signal (drives algorithm)
- **Profile views** — indicator of lead interest

## Warning Signs

- **0 likes** = very bad → LinkedIn heavily punishes low-quality content and decreases reach
- **Declining impressions** = content quality or posting cadence issue
- **Likes but no comments** = content is interesting but not conversation-starting
