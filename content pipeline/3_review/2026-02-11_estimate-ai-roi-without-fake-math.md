Every AI pitch deck I've seen has the same problem:

ROI numbers that look precise but are completely made up.

"We project a 340% return in 18 months."

Based on what? Assumptions stacked on assumptions.

Leadership sees through it every time.

I've pitched three AI projects that got funded.
None of them had a fancy ROI model.

Here's what I used instead — 3 questions:

1️⃣ What's the current cost of the problem?

Count it. Hours × people × frequency.

Our support team: 100 tickets/day × 15 min each = 25 hours/day of human time.
Our integration team: 1 integration/week × 5 days of back-and-forth = 80% was rework.

Observable. Verifiable. No assumptions needed.

2️⃣ What's the realistic automation rate?

Be conservative. Never promise 100%.

We targeted 70-85% of routine cases. Not all cases.
We automated spec generation but kept human review.

Leadership respects honesty more than optimism.

3️⃣ What's the "do nothing" cost?

What happens if you don't build this in 6 months?

Support: linear headcount growth to match ticket volume.
Integrations: backlog growing faster than team capacity.

This question is the closer. It turns "nice to have" into "urgent."

No fancy models.
No assumptions stacked on assumptions.
Just observable numbers, conservative targets, and the cost of inaction.

The result?

Leadership says yes faster — because they can verify every input themselves.

What's blocking your next AI project from getting approved?
