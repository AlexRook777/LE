A product team costs $1M/year.
Only 25% of their work delivers real impact.

That means $750K goes to bets that don't pay off.
You need a 4x return just to break even.

This is the math leadership already sees.
Most PMs don't.

But here's what changes when the PM is AI-mature:

The cost side drops.

An AI-mature PM doesn't need 5 engineers for a PoC.
They generate specs, feasibility checks, and technical analysis with AI.
They validate concepts before burning engineering cycles.
They ship a working PoC with 1-2 engineers instead of 5.

The hit rate goes up.

The 25% hit rate exists because teams spend months building before validating.
AI-mature PMs flip this:

→ Research and competitive analysis in hours, not weeks
→ Feasibility checks before a single sprint starts
→ Rapid prototyping → faster feedback → faster pivots
→ Bad bets die in days, not quarters

More experiments. Faster feedback. Lower cost per experiment.

But the real transformation is bigger than math.

When AI handles the routine — writing tickets, grooming backlogs, drafting specs, preparing sprint reviews — the PM's time shifts:

Before AI → 60% routine ops, 15% business thinking
After AI → 20% routine, 50% business outcomes & growth

The PM stops being a ticket janitor.
And starts being the person who owns the investment thesis.

Lower cost per experiment.
Higher hit rate.
PM focused on ROI, not process.

The PMs who learn this don't just survive the cost pressure.
They become the ones leadership trusts with bigger bets.

Where does most of your PM time actually go today?
