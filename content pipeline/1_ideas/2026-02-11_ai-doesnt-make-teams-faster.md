# AI Doesn't Make Your Team Faster

## Hook Concept

**"AI doesn't make your team faster. It extracts more value from the same team."**

## Key Insight / Value Payoff

Most companies adopt AI expecting **speed** — faster responses, faster deploys, faster everything. But the real ROI isn't speed. It's **value density** — getting more business outcomes from every hour your team already works.

When we automated reconciliation with Argus, the support team didn't work faster. They handled **the same number of hours** — but 70-85% of routine tickets disappeared, freeing them for complex cases that actually move the business. The value per hour skyrocketed.

When we built the PRD Assistant, engineers didn't type code faster. But instead of 1 integration per week, the same team delivered 3-4 per day — because the bottleneck was never coding speed, it was **wasted effort on unclear specs and rework**.

**The reframe:** Stop asking "How can AI make us faster?" Start asking "How can AI extract more value from the effort we're already spending?"

## Structure Notes

- **Pattern:** Contrarian reframe (borrowed from Shardul Mehta's PM post — adapted to AI/automation domain)
- **Matches template:** Template 2 (Contrarian Take + Proof) from content templates
- **Viral pattern:** "The Hard Truth Pivot" — challenge the "AI = speed" consensus with a "AI = value extraction" reality
- **Post anatomy:** Hook (bold reframe) → Story (Argus + PRD Assistant examples with metrics) → Value Payoff (the mental model shift) → CTA (ask what they're optimizing for)

## Metrics to Include

- 70-85% automation of routine support inquiries (Argus)
- 1 integration/week → 3-4/day with same team (PRD Assistant)
- Zero additional headcount for either transformation
