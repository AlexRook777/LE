# How to Estimate AI ROI Without Fake Math

## Hook Concept

**"Every AI pitch deck I've seen has the same problem: ROI numbers that look precise but are completely made up."**

## Key Insight / Value Payoff

When leadership asks "What's the ROI of this AI project?" — most teams do one of two things:

1. Over-engineer a spreadsheet with fake precision (assumptions stacked on assumptions)
2. Skip the math entirely and say "trust us, it's transformative"

Both kill credibility.

What actually works is **practical heuristics** — simple, defensible estimates rooted in observable pain:

**The 3-question framework I use before every AI project:**

1. **What's the current cost of the problem?** (Count it. Hours × people × frequency.)
   - Argus: 100 support tickets/day × ~15 min each = 25 hours/day of human time
   - PRD Assistant: 1 integration/week × 5 days of back-and-forth = 80% rework

2. **What's the realistic automation rate?** (Be conservative. Never promise 100%.)
   - Argus: targeted 70-85% of routine cases, not all cases
   - PRD Assistant: automated spec generation + validation, kept human review

3. **What's the "do nothing" cost?** (What happens if you don't build this in 6 months?)
   - Argus: linear headcount growth to match ticket volume
   - PRD Assistant: integration backlog growing faster than team capacity

No fancy models. No assumptions stacked on assumptions. Just observable numbers, conservative targets, and the cost of inaction.

The result? Leadership says yes faster — because they can verify the inputs themselves.

## Structure Notes

- **Pattern:** Relatable problem (fake ROI math) → Failed approaches (over-engineering vs hand-waving) → Practical framework (3 questions) → Real examples with metrics → Takeaway
- **Matches template:** Template 3 (Step-by-Step Framework) from content templates
- **Viral pattern:** Shares DNA with "The Zero-to-One How-To" — shows how to do something complicated in a scrappy, practical way
- **Post anatomy:** Hook (bold observation about fake ROI) → Story (two common mistakes) → Value Payoff (3-question framework with real numbers) → CTA (ask what blocking their next AI project approval)

## Metrics to Include

- 100 support tickets/day → 15 after automation (Argus)
- 1 integration/week → 3-4/day (PRD Assistant)
- 70-85% realistic automation target (not 100% promises)
- Zero additional headcount for scale
