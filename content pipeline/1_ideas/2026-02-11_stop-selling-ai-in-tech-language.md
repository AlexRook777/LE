# Stop Selling AI in Tech Language

## Hook Concept

**"AI engineers are the worst salespeople. We pitch 'multi-agent orchestration with RAG pipelines.' Leadership hears noise."**

## Key Insight / Value Payoff

There's a language gap killing AI adoption inside companies. Engineers describe AI work in tech terms — model accuracy, token costs, latency, architecture patterns. Leadership decides budgets in business terms — revenue impact, cost per ticket, headcount savings, risk reduction.

Same project. Two completely different languages. And when they don't match, your AI initiative loses funding.

**The reframe with real examples:**

| What we said (tech) | What leadership needed to hear (business) |
|---|---|
| "Multi-agent orchestration with QA validation loops" | "85% fewer support tickets, same team size" |
| "Spec-driven methodology with OpenAPI linting" | "4× integration throughput, zero new hires" |
| "Multi-provider AI with confidence scoring" | "Receipt processing in 12 languages, 20% lower cost" |

Every time you pitch AI in tech language:
- Your budget gets questioned
- Your timeline gets cut
- Your project gets deprioritized

It doesn't happen dramatically. Just slow erosion.

**The fix:** Before any stakeholder conversation, translate every technical achievement into one of these: revenue gained, cost saved, risk reduced, time recovered.

## Structure Notes

- **Pattern:** Analogy + language gap + consequences + playbook (borrowed from Shardul Mehta's PM/car salesperson post — adapted to AI engineering domain)
- **Matches template:** Template 4 (Personal Story + Lesson) with elements of Template 2 (Contrarian Take)
- **Viral pattern:** "The Hard Truth Pivot" — challenges engineers to stop speaking tech and start speaking business
- **Post anatomy:** Hook (bold analogy) → Story (table comparing tech vs business framing from real projects) → Consequences (slow erosion of influence) → Value Payoff (the translation rule) → CTA (ask what they struggle to translate)

## Metrics to Include

- 70-85% automation (Argus — "85% fewer support tickets")
- 3-4 integrations/day (PRD Assistant — "4× throughput")
- 12+ languages (OCR — global scalability as business value)
- All three framed as business outcomes, not tech achievements
