Automation doesn't fix broken processes. It scales them.

Most companies think: "Our process is slow → let's add AI → problem solved."

But here's what I've seen after years of building automation pipelines:

If your team handles exceptions by Slacking each other "hey, what do we do here?" — an AI agent will do the same thing. Except it won't wait for an answer. It'll guess. Confidently. At scale.

🔍 A pattern I keep seeing:
Company wants to "automate customer onboarding."
I ask: "Show me the current process."
They show me 14 variations across 3 spreadsheets and a Google Doc called "PROCESS v7 FINAL (2)."

That's not a process. That's tribal knowledge.

Before you spend a dollar on AI:
→ Map the real process (not the one on your wiki — the one people actually follow)
→ Kill the exceptions that shouldn't exist
→ Standardize the happy path

Then automate. You'll be shocked how simple it becomes when the process is clean.

The best automation projects I've done started with zero code — just a whiteboard and hard questions.

What's the messiest process you've ever been asked to automate?
