I built an automation that was supposed to save 40 hours a week. Instead, it created a bottleneck worse than the original.

The system was fast. Invoices processed, validated, and ready in under 2 minutes. But the last step — "Manager Approval" — took an average of 11 hours.

Eleven hours. For a single click.

She wasn't lazy. She had 200 other things fighting for her attention. Our notification was just another item in a flooded inbox.

The entire pipeline — built for speed — sat idle, waiting for a human.

What I learned:

1. **"Human-in-the-loop" is often "human-as-bottleneck."** If every routine action needs a person to click "approve," you don't have automation — you have a fancier to-do list.

2. **Design for exceptions, not routine.** We restructured: auto-approve under the threshold, surface only anomalies. She went from 150 reviews/day to 3.

3. **Trust is architecture, not culture.** Guardrails that make manual oversight unnecessary — that's real trust.

After the redesign: 11-hour delays → real-time processing. No extra AI. No extra cost. Just fewer unnecessary human steps.

If your automation still needs someone to press "Go" every time — you've just built a faster queue.

Ever seen an approval step kill a perfectly good automation?
