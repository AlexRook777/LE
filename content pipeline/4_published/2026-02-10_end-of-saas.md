12 SaaS tools. $47k/year. Zero connected data. Sound familiar?

A company I worked with had separate tools for CRM, invoicing, project tracking, support tickets, document signing, analytics, email campaigns, and "internal comms." Each with its own login, its own data silo, its own monthly bill.

The bottleneck wasn't any single tool. It was the space between them.

What we built:
A custom AI agent layer talking directly to raw APIs — no middleware, no Zapier chains. One orchestration layer that reads, writes, and decides across all their data.

The numbers:
📉 Before: 12 tools, $47k/year, 6 hrs/week manual data syncing
🚀 After: 4 core tools + 1 agent layer, $18k/year, zero manual syncing

The SaaS era taught us to buy a tool for every problem. The AI era is different: you don't need 12 dashboards. You need one intelligent layer that connects the dots.

Half your subscriptions exist because your systems can't talk to each other. An agent that can makes them redundant.

The question isn't "which tool next?" It's "which tools disappear when your systems actually communicate?"

What's the most redundant SaaS tool in your stack?
