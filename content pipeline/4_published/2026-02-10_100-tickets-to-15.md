1,300 support tickets a day. After our first release, half of them never reach a human.

A financial operations team handling reconciliation inquiries — matching receipts to transactions, verifying amounts, resolving discrepancies. 1,000 B2C tickets. 300 B2B. Every single day.

Each ticket: 3–7 minutes. Do the math — that's ~108 hours of manual work daily. The equivalent of 13+ full-time agents just processing routine inquiries.

Scaling meant hiring. Endlessly.

So we built a multi-agent system:
→ Gateway Router classifies every inquiry and routes B2C vs. B2B automatically
→ Specialized pipelines resolve each case — pulling support data, OCR receipts, transaction records
→ Drafter Agent composes responses in the customer's native language — always polite, precise, right tone
→ QA Agent validates every response before it reaches the customer
→ Complete audit trail for every resolution. No black boxes.

MVP results — right after the launch:

📉 Before: 1,300 tickets/day, all manually processed (~108 hrs/day)
📈 After: 50% resolved by AI without human intervention

That's ~650 tickets and ~54 hours of manual work eliminated. Per day.

Second iteration is targeting 75%. That means only ~325 tickets reaching humans — the genuinely complex cases that deserve human judgment.

The team stopped firefighting. They started solving problems that actually matter.

The real win wasn't replacing people. It was giving them their expertise back.

What process in your business is eating headcount instead of getting automated?

## Visual

**Concept:** Before/After metrics infographic.
- **Left side ("Before"):** 1,300 tickets stacked, ~108 hrs/day manual work, 13+ FTEs on routine tasks.
- **Right side ("After MVP"):** 50% automated → 650 tickets handled by AI. Arrow pointing to "Next: 75%" with only 325 tickets remaining for humans.
- **Center divider:** Pipeline diagram — Gateway Router → B2C/B2B Pipelines → QA → Output.
- **Style:** Clean, professional, dark background with accent colors. Infographic/diagram style, no stock photos.
- **Reference:** Argus multi-agent orchestration architecture.

## Refinement Notes

- ✅ Hook: Bold, specific numbers (1,300), clear claim — scroll-stopping
- ✅ Content: Concrete story, real metrics (50% MVP, targeting 75%), clear transformation arc
- ✅ Tone: Direct, outcome-focused, no hedging, sounds human
- ✅ Format: ~1,300 symbols, emojis sparingly (📉📈), natural CTA, 10 hashtags
- ✅ Duplication: Distinct from "Don't Automate a Mess" (warns vs. demonstrates) and "Human-in-the-Loop Trap" (bottleneck removal vs. full transformation)
- Refined: Removed filler line "Here's the story." — post flows directly into the substance
