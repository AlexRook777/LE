# LinkedIn Content Factory — Agent Context

## Project Identity

This project is a **LinkedIn content factory** for lead generation. It produces posts,
images, and research to attract potential clients and invite conversations that lead to
project-based agreements.

**Core expertise being marketed:**
- Finding and analyzing business process bottlenecks
- Designing solutions using modern architecture & AI engineering
- Implementing automation to unblock business growth

**Target audience:** Decision-makers (CTOs, VPs, founders, hiring managers) in tech,
fintech, and digital transformation — people who have scaling problems their current
processes can't solve.

## Content Framework

Every post must be defined using the **3-axis content formula**:

**Category × Perspective × Topic = Post**

### Categories (what the post does)

| Category     | Purpose                                     | Priority      |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Educate**  | Teach practical skills that solve real problems | **Primary** — main driver of leads |
| **Convince** | Show proof of results (case studies, testimonials) | Secondary — reinforces credibility |
| **Inspire**  | Share stories that build trust and thought leadership | Supporting — builds connection |
| **Entertain**| Creative/fun content that boosts reach | Supporting — boosts reach |

### Perspectives (how you speak)

| Perspective              | Description                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Expert Advice (Niche)**| Deep, specific insights proving deep knowledge       |
| **General Advice (Broad)**| Useful tips reaching wider audiences                |
| **Personal Story**       | Real wins, struggles, and lessons — relatable, human |

### Topic Anchoring

All content anchors to this core topic chain:
**AI & Automation → Business Process Optimization → Measurable Business Results**

Sub-topics include but are not limited to:
- AI-augmented workflows / agentic pipelines
- Process bottleneck identification
- Spec-driven development (SIP methodology)
- Human + AI collaboration patterns
- Active verification & autonomous testing
- Integration pipelines & automation ROI
- Scaling constraints vs. automation opportunities
- AI engineering in practice (not theory)

## Post Anatomy Rules

Maximum post length: **≤ 3000 symbols** (LinkedIn platform limit).
Recommended length: **800–1500 symbols** for maximum engagement.

1. **Trigger (Hook)** — One bold, clear line that stops the scroll. Must create curiosity, tension, or a bold claim.
2. **Story** — A quick personal moment or real example making the point relatable.
3. **Value Payoff** — The practical takeaway, insight, or lesson.
4. **CTA** — A soft call to action: invite comment, ask a question, offer to share more.

### Style Rules

- **Emojis** — Use sparingly for visual breaks. No childish emojis.
- **Visuals** — Photos, slides, or short videos boost visibility. Personal imagery wins over stock.
- **Trim the fat** — Cut everything non-essential. Short, punchy, high-value beats long and fluffy.
- **No AI slop** — Content must reflect unique perspective, real experience, and genuine opinions. Generic AI-generated text destroys credibility.
- **Hashtags** — Include 5-10 relevant hashtags at the end of the post (separated by a divider).

## Tone & Voice

Derived from published content (PRD Assistant Article):

| Attribute        | Description                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Direct**       | No hedging. State claims and results clearly.                   |
| **Outcome-focused** | Lead with results, numbers, impact. "What happened after…"  |
| **Data-backed**  | Use real numbers, timelines, metrics wherever possible.         |
| **Story-driven** | Wrap insights in real scenarios — "I looked at this and saw…"  |
| **Authoritative but accessible** | Expert knowledge, plain language. No jargon for jargon's sake. |
| **Pattern-revealing** | Show the underlying pattern, not just the specific case.    |
| **Action-oriented** | End with what the reader can do or think about next.         |

**Avoid:**
- Vague, motivational fluff with no substance
- Overly technical language that alienates non-engineers
- Humble-bragging without real takeaways
- Generic advice that could come from anyone

---

## Publishing Rules

- **Frequency:** 2-3 posts per week
- **Cannibalization:** Never post within 17 hours of a previous post
- **Timing:** Target high-activity periods — mornings 8:00-9:00 AM or afternoons 5:00-6:00 PM
- **Tags:** Tag people only if they'll engage quickly; otherwise skip
- **Reposts:** Don't repost unless writing an entirely new perspective
- **Follow Primary CTA:** Keep "Follow" as the primary CTA on the LinkedIn profile

## Workflow Guidance

When assisting with content creation, follow this pipeline:

### 1. Research
- Scan LinkedIn for trending topics in AI, automation, business process optimization
- Review `research/` files for existing findings
- Check `content pipeline/5_published/` to avoid duplication

### 2. Ideate
- Generate post ideas using the 3-axis formula
- Mix categories and perspectives across the week
- Save ideas to `content pipeline/1_ideas/`

### 3. Draft
- Start with the value payoff — what's the key insight?
- Write the hook last — make it bold and scroll-stopping
- Follow post anatomy rules strictly
- Save drafts to `content pipeline/2_drafts/`

### 4. Refine
- Cut ruthlessly — keep under 3000 symbols, ideally 800–1500
- Verify tone matches the voice guide
- Add hashtags
- Move to `content pipeline/3_ready_for_review/`

### 5. Approve & Schedule
- User reviews and approves
- Move to `content pipeline/4_scheduled/` with planned date
- After publishing, move to `content pipeline/5_published/`

### 6. Analyze
- Track performance in `analytics/`
- Identify winning posts and patterns
- Feed insights back into research

## Autonomy Levels

The project is designed for progressive autonomy:

| Phase | Agent Role | User Role |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Phase 1 (Current)** | Research, suggest ideas, draft posts | Review everything, approve all posts |
| **Phase 2** | Generate and refine posts, manage pipeline | Review final drafts, approve scheduling |
| **Phase 3** | Full pipeline management, trend monitoring | Spot-check, strategic direction only |

---

## Key Constraints

- Always check `content pipeline/5_published/` before creating any post — **never duplicate** a topic already covered
- Always reference `linkedin methodology/` files when making content strategy decisions
- Post files should be clean Markdown with frontmatter indicating: title, category, perspective, topic, status, planned date
- Images for posts should be generated using the `generate_image` tool when needed
