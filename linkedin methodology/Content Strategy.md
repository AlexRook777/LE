# **Content Strategy**

### **Introduction**

* Content gives you reach — it puts your name in front of people on autopilot  
* Over time, this builds a following and positions you as an expert in your field  
* This authority leads to trust, and trust leads to warm inbound leads   
* A consistent content schedule can eventually snowball into a steady stream of work  
* There’s a difference between creating content to grow a **personal brand** vs. **generating leads**

### **Principles to keep in mind**

1. **Long-term**: Inbound is a long-term play. You should think of your timeline in years, not months.  
2. **Consistency**: Inbound requires monk-like consistency and discipline (e.g., 1x YouTube video or 2x LinkedIn posts per week for 18 months straight).  
3. **Value**: Inbound is an exchange: value for attention. 

Here's an equation to explain this: **Value** x **Consistency** x **Time** \= Inbound Success

* More Value \= More Success  
* More Consistency \= More Success  
* More Time \= More Success

If either variable is 0 (or close to 0), your Net Success will be 0\.

### **Do I need to create content?**

* Content isn’t required for everyone — success doesn’t depend on it  
* Long-term goal; outbound → Inbound (content is one way to do that, but not the only way)  
* If you go all-in on **Upwork**, your profile and reviews become your reputation engine  
* **Recruiters** don’t care about your content — they care if you can fill roles  
* Your **network** and **previous client** pool will grow which can all lead to inbound deals   
* As you move toward more FECs, visibility matters more to keep a consistent pipeline  
* More projects \= more selling → content becomes a leverage tool to keep your pipeline full

### **Platforms**

* Two channels consistently work for tech freelancers: **LinkedIn** & **YouTube**  
* These channels work because:  
  * They have distribution built into the platform (algorithm)  
  * Potential clients spend time on the platform  
* Pick one and go all-in before expanding to others  
* Pick one based on what fits you — writing (LinkedIn) or being on camera (YouTube)  
* **X** can also work, but I don’t have experience with that platform (similar strategy to LinkedIn)

#### **LinkedIn**

* Easiest way to build reach in the B2B world  
* Algorithm helps push your content to new people  
* Followers \= authority \= more inbound opportunities  
* Great for testing ideas fast and learning what resonates  
* Can help you land **BECs** as well as **FECs**

#### **YouTube**

* Best platform to build deep trust and true authority  
* Videos can keep driving views for years (search \+ recommendations)  
* A strong channel can completely remove the need for outreach  
* YouTube is hard and takes insane amount of work (generally not recommended for beginners)  
* Will generally only help you to land **FECs**

#### **Blog Posts (Add-On for LinkedIn strategy)**

* They work, but bringing traffic to your own site is hard  
* No built-in audience → requires distribution from other platforms  
* Use blogs for deeper value, then share short snippets on LinkedIn to drive attention  
* Real value is tough to fit in a single LinkedIn post — blogs allow depth

### **My recommendation**

* Post regularly on LinkedIn if you plan to use the **Social Selling** strategy (except recruiters)  
* Write blog posts for deeper problems and topics (share snippets on LinkedIn)  
* Amplifies every metric: acceptance rate, reply rate, reach, engagement, inbound leads  
* More followers → more people see your content → more opportunities  
* Every post grows the snowball of visibility  
* Builds perception of authority (even early on)

### **Goals and strategy**

* The goal: create content about topics directly connected to the services you sell  
* When people learn from you, they start to see you as the authority  
* Most people are too scared to create content — that alone makes you stand out  
* Perception matters: if you speak confidently on a subject, people assume you know it  
* Even if you’re just starting, professional content makes you look like an expert fast  
* When you solve problems publicly, people with those problems come to you privately  
* Content is a magnet — it attracts the types of clients your topics are aligned with  
* Simple rule: talk about the exact work you want to get paid for  
* What you publish \= what people will hire you for  
* That’s why you uncover **pain points** from your ICP during intro calls (Social Selling Playbook)  
* There are different sub strategies for every platforms (algorithms constantly change)
