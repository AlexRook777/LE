# **LinkedIn Content Playbook**

Make sure you first go through: [Content Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYkIeg1c7hxaN2_vqHZ0T8VfjCngqNVTMFrlKzKKEvg/edit?usp=sharing)

### **Introduction**

* You can create posts on LinkedIn that will show up in people’s feed  
* Text is the foundation, but you can add videos, images, links, and PDFs  
* The algorithm: small follower pool → more followers → beyond followers → viral  
* It’s recommend to post 2-3 times per week for to maximize the effectiveness  
* Make sure “follow” is the [primary CTA](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/followed) on your LinkedIn profile

### **Content categories**

* **Educate** → Teach practical skills and insights that solve real problems (main driver of leads)  
* **Convince** → Show proof you can deliver results through case studies and testimonials  
* **Inspire** → Share stories and perspectives that build trust and position you as a thought leader  
* **Entertain** → Grab attention with creative or fun content that boosts reach and likability

* If your goal is **lead generation**, focus on *Educate* first — it directly attracts buyers  
* *Convince* reinforces why you’re the right choice once they’re interested  
* *Inspire* and *Entertain* help you grow faster and build connection with your followers  
* Each category plays a different role in the **buyer’s journey** — together they move people from awareness → trust → action

### **Content perspectives**

* **Personal Story** → Share real wins, struggles, and lessons so people can relate to you  
* **Expert Advice (Niche)** → Deep, specific insights that prove you know your craft   
* **General Advice (Broad)** → Useful tips and opinions that reach wider audiences

* Personal stories can support **all four content types** (entertain, inspire, educate, convince)  
* Mix niche and broad content to balance **authority** and **reach**  
* Lead gen improves when people see both:  
  * you *know* your topic (expert)  
  * you’re a real person they can trust (story)

### **Content topics (what to write about)**

* **Anchor everything to your main expertise** → Your job title (or the one you’re transitioning into) is your **core topic** — e.g. *AI*, *Data Science*, *MLOps*, etc.  
* **Stay in your lane** → Most of your posts should relate to your core topic so people instantly know what to come to you for.  
* **Optional personal posts** → Share wins, lessons, and interests to build connection — but don’t let personal content become your main theme.  
* **Break your core topic into micro-topics** → E.g. for AI: prompt engineering, LLM architectures, vector DBs, MLOps, privacy, RAG, etc. → this keeps ideas flowing forever.  
* **Use your real calls as inspiration** → Don’t overthink “target audience”; write about problems your actual leads mention — that guarantees content-market fit.  
* **Combine all three frameworks** → *Category* (educate/entertain/inspire/convince) × *Perspective* (expert/general/personal) × *Topic* \= ready-to-post content.

### **Examples**

The content formula then becomes: **Category** x **Perspective** x **Topic**

* **Educate** \+ **Expert** → “How to fine-tune an LLM on just 500 labeled examples (step-by-step).”

* **Inspire** \+ **Personal Story** → “I automated my first client’s workflow and saved them 20 hours/week — here’s what I learned.”

* **Entertain** \+ **General Advice** → “5 types of clients every AI freelancer meets (and how to survive them).”

### **LinkedIn post anatomy**

Aim to keep post below 800 chars:

* **Trigger:** Hook attention fast — one bold, clear line that makes your audience stop scrolling.  
* **Story:** Share a quick personal moment or real example to make the point relatable  
* **Emojis:** Use sparingly to add tone and visual breaks — avoid anything that feels childish  
* **Visuals:** Photos, slides, or short videos boost visibility — personal imagery wins over stock.  
* **Trim the fat:** Cut everything that isn’t essential. Short, punchy, high-value beats long and fluffy every time.

### **Tools**

* You can [schedule posts](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1347212) to batch content and save time (LinkedIn native)  
* Tools like [Hypefurry](https://hypefury.com/) and [Typefully](https://typefully.com/) can help with planning, writing, publishing, and cross posting  
* I personally write all my emails / text-based posts in **Cursor** and commit to a GitHub repo  
* Ultimately, tools only help with the **last 10%**. AI can clean up your writing, but it **can’t replace your ideas**. The part that actually matters — your unique perspective, experiences, and opinions — still has to come from you.  
* The fastest way to kill your credibility is to post **generic, AI-generated slop**. If your content feels like it could’ve been written by anyone… people will treat you like anyone.

### **Extra tips**

* Avoid **cannibalizing** your reach. Posting multiple times within 17 hours or while another post is active can reduce visibility.  
* **Consider timing**. While there's no perfect time to post, aim for high-activity periods like mornings between 8:00-9:00 AM or afternoons from 5:00-6:00 PM.  
* Use **tagging** people wisely. Tagging can boost your post in phase one if the person engages quickly. Otherwise, it might hurt your post's performance.  
* Don't use the **repost** function, unless you plan to write an entirely new perspective on it.  
* When you create a **viral** post, your next post will automatically get more reach as well. That is why you consistently want to create high quality content.  
* Following the Social Selling strategy will increase your **SSI** which will boost your reach

### **Research**

* Go to LinkedIn and find 5 profiles that have 10k+ followers  
* Study their profile: headline, banner, links, featured, CTAs, website, funnel  
* Write down what you like / what you don’t like  
* Scroll through their posts and study the 5 most viral posts for each profile  
* Get a feel for the structure, hook, topics, media – to learn why the post went viral  
* Repeat this exercise whenever your out of ideas and/or motivation

### **Weekly workflow**

* Decide how many times per week you want to post  
* Decide if you want to batch write content on *one day* vs. *spread over multiple days*  
* Brainstorm ideas based on; **intro calls**, news, experiences, client projects  
* Pick your topics for that week and decide the best **category** x **perception** per topic  
* Start drafting out the core story, beginning with the final pay off / value you want to share  
* Check if you want to leverage [proven content templates](https://airtable.com/appdq4sxsuKn17Vi3/shrWuTGRpAYoBopOd/tblthYte7J9uU0vYN)  
* Now structure your entire post from start to finish  
* Fill in the gaps where needed and make the final adjustments (you can use AI here)  
* Schedule / publish your posts and reply to all comments  
* Make sure to track your results and winning posts: [https://www.linkedin.com/dashboard/](https://www.linkedin.com/dashboard/)  
* You’re **successful** if you see all numbers go up; post impressions, likes/comments, profile views  
* If you get 0 likes on a post \- that’s really bad. Watch out for this as LinkedIn **heavily punishes** low quality content and will decrease your reach over time.
