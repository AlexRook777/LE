# **LinkedIn Social Selling Playbook**

Based on the years of results inside Data Freelancer and hundreds of student outcomes, this LinkedIn Social Selling strategy is the most repeatable and algorithmic way to land freelance work—whether you’re aiming for long-term backend contracts (BECs), short-term frontend gigs (FECs), working with recruiters, partnering with agencies, or selling directly B2B.

### **Introduction**

* With [**social selling**](https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/social-selling) you connect and build relationships with prospects through social networks.  
* Sales navigator is LinkedIn’s **B2B sales tool** built for anyone trying to sell through LinkedIn.  
* Gives you **far more search filters** than standard LinkedIn — lets you target with real precision.  
* Enables strategies that **aren’t possible** or are **much harder** with normal LinkedIn search.  
* Designed for **proactive client acquisition**: find decision-makers, recruiters, founders, etc.  
* Cleaner interface for **sending, tracking, and organizing** connection requests.  
* Lets you create **saved leads & saved accounts** to manage your pipeline like a mini-CRM.  
* Makes it easier to see **who accepted** your connection request to streamline messaging.  
* Allows **higher weekly connection request limits** than standard LinkedIn (often \~200/week depending on account health).  
* This strategy works on *every* social network. LinkedIn \+ Sales Navigator is just the best for our goals as freelancers

### **High level strategy**

1. Get a Sales Navigator subscription  
2. Figure out who you want to target: Recruiters, Startups, Partners, Direct B2B  
3. Create  a search filter for your ideal client profile (ICP), building of your base  
4. Max out your \~200 weekly connection requests (send invite without a message)  
5. When people accept, open with a simple message asking for their insights, and offer a free resource once they show interest — then use it to lead into a coffee chat  
6. Frame the conversation about better understanding their industry / current problems  
7. On the calls, figure out pain points people are having, and then try and identify some kind of median of those pain points. Make sure to record all calls and aim to do around 20-30  
8. Write content about the paint points you’ve identified to drive inbound leads (optional)  
9. Simultaneously, address the pain points that people have experienced and present solutions to them in a follow-up call.

### **Platform features**

* **Leads** — find individual people who match your target profile using advanced search filters (titles, industry, seniority, geography, etc.) so you can reach out to decision-makers and hiring-related roles.   
* **Accounts** — search and save companies (target firms) as “accounts,” enabling you to target organizations rather than just people — useful when you want to find all relevant leads within a specific company.   
* **Lists (Saved Leads / Saved Accounts)** — organize saved leads or accounts into custom lists to manage outreach, segment prospects by vertical/region/priority, and keep your pipeline structured.   
* **Messaging / InMail** — send direct messages to leads outside your 1st-degree network (InMail) or connection requests via the platform, giving you outreach reach beyond your existing connections.   
* **Personas & Advanced Search Filters** — define an “ideal customer profile” by using built-in Personas or custom filter combos (function, seniority, region, industry, company size etc.), so search results closely match your target client/recruiter profile.

### **LinkedIn profile optimization**

Before you start outreach, make sure your LinkedIn profile actually looks like someone worth talking to. We already covered this in detail in Week 3, but here’s a simple recap of the parts that matter most. If you can’t add certain elements because of your current job, skip it — just make sure the rest of your profile still signals the type of work you want to do.

* Pick a clear title for yourself (Data Scientist, AI Engineer, ML Engineer, etc.) and stick to it — choose what you **want to do**, not what you did in the past.  
* Put **Freelancer** (or Consultant/Contractor) at the front of your headline so people instantly understand how you work.  
* Keep your picture and banner clean and professional — looks matter more than people think.  
* Include a link in your profile to your website, portfolio, or anything relevant; it’s more about perception than clicks.  
* Use your Featured section to show you’re open for work: include a “Book a call” link and at least one strong piece of work (blog, project, portfolio, etc.).  
* Fill out the rest of your profile normally, but don’t overthink it — the headline, visuals, and featured section carry the most weight.  
* Aim for a baseline level of credibility: max out the 500 connections and \~1,000 followers (helpful but not required). A clean, professional profile often works even without an audience.  
* The goal is simple: look like a capable freelance professional, not a beginner, so people feel comfortable taking a coffee chat with you.

### **Creating your free resource**

Before you start messaging people, you want something small and useful you can offer in exchange for their insights. This creates a pattern interrupt. Most outreach on LinkedIn is generic, so giving value first instantly makes you stand out and increases your reply rate.

**Why we do this**

* It breaks the usual “basic outreach message” pattern people ignore.  
* It positions you as someone curious, thoughtful, and actually doing research.  
* It acknowledges the other person’s expertise and gives them a reason to respond.  
* It sets up a natural exchange: *you share insights → I share something useful back*.  
* It makes the conversation feel collaborative, not salesy.

**How to frame the conversation**

* Present yourself as someone learning about their industry or a specific problem space.  
* Examples:

  * “I’m working on a short report about challenges in AI/automation.”  
  * “I’m speaking with people in your field to understand what’s changing right now.”  
  * “I’m doing some research on common issues teams face with data/ML projects.”

* This framing gives the other person light expert status — you’re inviting them to share their perspective.

**How to create your free resource**

* Keep it simple: one document, one page, or one list.  
* It must be genuinely helpful for the type of person you’re reaching out to.  
* Ideas:

  * A list of useful tools, creators, or newsletters in their domain  
  * A short checklist (e.g., “How to scope small AI/automation projects”)  
  * A curated list of high-quality tutorials or frameworks  
  * A “starter kit” of resources in your specialty

* Don’t overthink it — relevance matters more than production quality.  
* [Here’s an example from Ravi which he kindly shared.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EejW-p-isUeIa0tRNBhuKTTzWYuh_StrOJ21xJ82NN8/edit?usp=sharing)

**How we use it in the conversation**

* First message: ask for their insights and mention you have a resource you can share *after* they respond.  
* Once they reply: send the resource and ask if they’re open to a quick call.  
* The resource acts as a soft bridge into a conversation, not the main value proposition.

**Special note on recruiters**

* Recruiters don’t need a bonus resource — they’re already incentivized to talk to you.  
* With recruiters, you can skip the exchange and go straight to asking for a quick chat.

### **Creating a Search**

* Go to **linkedin.com/sales** → click **Lead Filters** to open the full filter panel.  
* You’ll see filters grouped by **Company**, **Role**, **Personal**, **Buyer intent**, **Best Path In**, and **Workflow** — this is where you build your targeting logic.  
* [Full list of filters for leads and accounts (companies)](https://www.linkedin.com/help/sales-navigator/answer/a1452817)  
* **Save search to get notified of new results**

#### **Default filters**

I recommend always using these filters, regardless of the search:

* **Best in path**: 2nd-degree and 3rd-degree connections (build of your base)  
* **Workflow**: Exclude people you messaged (auto updates the list as you connect \+ message)  
* **Saved leads and accounts:** Exclude → **All my saved leads**  
* This ensures your search shows only *new* prospects you haven’t already contacted.

#### **Example: Targeting Startups / Small Tech Companies**

These filters identify founders, executives, and early-stage decision-makers inside small, fast-moving companies — ideal for data/AI freelancers.

**Company**

* **Company headcount:** **1–10** and **11–50**  
* **Current company:** leave empty (optional: add specific companies if needed).  
* **Company type:** leave open (startup founders often don’t label company type).

**Role**

* **Seniority level:** **Owner/Partner**, **CXO**, **Director**, **Vice President**  
* **Years in current company/position:** **Less than 1 year**  
* **Function:** leave empty for maximum reach (optional: narrow to *Engineering*, *IT*, *Software Development* if you want more relevance).

**Personal**

* **Geography:** **United States** (or your target region).  
* **Industry:** optional — recommended ones for data/AI freelancers include:

  * Software Development  
  * Data Infrastructure & Analytics  
  * IT Services / Custom Software

**Best Path In**

* **Connection:** **2nd-degree** and **3rd-degree**  
* **Connections of / Past colleagues / Shared experiences:** leave off unless you want warm intro paths.

Using the above filters, you get **\~10,000 decision-makers** inside US tech startups/scale-ups.

#### **Example: IT / Data Recruiters**

* Use the search term: **Recruiter AND (Data OR IT)**  
* Adjust your location(s)  
* Leave everything else open

#### **Example: IT Partners**

* **Search terms to try:**  
  * IT Consulting  
  * Digital transformation  
  * Software development  
* **Industries to try**:  
  * IT services and IT consulting  
  * Software development  
  * Technology, information, internet  
  * IT System data services  
* **Company headcount:** **1–10** and **11–50**  
* **Seniority level:** Owner/Partner, CXO, Director, Vice President

#### **Example: Marketing Agencies**

* **Industry**: Marketing Services  
* **Seniority level:** Owner/Partner, CXO, Director, Vice President  
* **Geography**: Set to your country / city

#### **Example: Direct B2B (Dentists)**

* **Industry**: Dentists  
* **Seniority level:** Owner/Partner, CXO, Director, Vice President  
* **Geography**: Set to your country / city

#### **More Examples**

With Sales Navigator, the possibilities are endless in terms of who you can target, so get creative\! Don’t limit yourself to the examples I provided here; experiment with different search phrases. Be sure to adjust it for your country and language as well. This is the best way to dial in searches for:

* Recruiters / Hiring Managers  
* Start-ups  
* Partners  
* Direct B2B

### **Daily workflow**

Follow this daily workflow to consistently generate leads using your Sales Navigator strategy. Make sure to track everything in your: [Social Selling Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PWzC2QNCxmlgrFec-Te7cJ61Qw8oPkTQxyBauzd2KCI/edit?usp=sharing)

#### **Connection workflow**

* Open Sales Navigator and review your saved searches  
* Go through the leads and qualify them carefully (you only have \~200 connects per week)  
* Connect with anyone who fits your criteria (send the invite without a message)  
* The lead gets added to your general saved leads list automatically

#### **Reply workflow**

* When someone accepts your connection request, send your cold DM asking for their insights and offering your free resource in exchange.  
* Keep the message simple and curious — something like *“I’m working on a short paper about common problems in AI products and would love your perspective.”*  
* Mention the resource right away so the exchange feels natural (“I have a document with useful ML resources I can share back with you”).  
* Once they reply positively (“sure” / “happy to help”), send the free resource directly on LinkedIn.  
* After sharing the resource, follow up with a short ask for a quick coffee chat to go a bit deeper.  
* Use your scheduling link to lock in the call easily.  
* The tone stays innocent and curious: you’re gathering insights, not trying to sell anything upfront.  
* This flow works because people like being treated as experts and tend to reciprocate value, and once they’ve said “yes” to a small request, they’re far more likely to say “yes” again to the coffee chat.

#### **Call workflow**

* Record every call so you can review the conversations and spot pain points.  
* When you have a strong profile, many people will join the call already interested in your services.  
* At the same time, not everyone has a need — so have a light set of questions ready to uncover challenges in their projects or workflow.  
* Let them talk; you asked for the chat, so be ready to guide the conversation.  
* Don’t jump into solving things unless they directly ask for advice.  
* If they show interest or bring up a problem, naturally shift into exploring whether you could help.  
* Some calls will convert right away; others won’t — both are normal.

#### **If you’re not getting traction**

* Make sure you’re targeting the right people (review their profiles\!)  
* Fix/improve your profile because if you don’t look credible, people won’t reply or book calls.  
* Rewrite your cold DM to make it shorter, clearer, and a lighter ask.  
* Upgrade your free resource so it’s more relevant and actually useful to the people you target.  
* Strengthen your branding by posting, commenting, and showing visible activity.  
* Be more direct by offering help around the pain points and clearly suggesting a follow-up call.

#### **Variables**

Treat your outreach like a scientific experiment: only change one variable at a time and keep everything else consistent so you actually know what caused the result. Don’t tweak your profile, targeting, or message flow until you’ve collected at least **100 data points**. You need the law of large numbers to kick in before making any decisions.

* Profile (headline. picture, banner, featured, followers)  
* Targeting (sales navigator search filters)  
* Opening message \+ free resource  
* Follow-up message to book a call  
* Call strategy and questions you ask

---

### **Example message flow**

Here’s a simplified version of what a successful conversation often looks like.

#### **Message 1 — Your cold DM**

* “Hey {{name}}, thanks for connecting\! I’m working on a short report about common problems in {{your topic}} and noticed you’re in the field. Would you be open to sharing a few thoughts?  
  In exchange, I have a small resource that people have found useful — happy to send it your way.”

#### **Their reply**

* “Sure, happy to help.”

#### **Message 2 — Send the free resource**

* “Awesome, appreciate it\! Here’s the resource I mentioned. Hope it’s helpful.”

#### **Message 3 — Ask for the call**

* “Would you be open to a quick coffee chat? I’d love to dive a little deeper into your experience.”

#### **Their reply**

* “Yeah, let’s do it.”

#### **Message 4 — Send your link**

* Awesome, you can use the following link to book a call: \<you booking link\>  
  Is there any time that works for you?

---

### **Expected results**

When you apply this strategy consistently with a decent profile and clean messaging, you can expect predictable outcomes. Most people who follow this playbook see similar patterns in their numbers and the types of conversations they generate.

#### **What you can generally expect**

* Around **100–200 connection requests per week** (limited by LinkedIn).  
* A **15–30% acceptance rate** if your profile looks credible.  
* **10–30 positive replies** per week from people willing to share insights.  
* **5–10 coffee chats booked** each week once you refine your message flow.

* A handful of calls that naturally turn into:

  * Early-stage project discussions  
  * Small paid test projects  
  * Ongoing part-time freelance work  
  * Agency partnerships that send you repeated opportunities

* A few people may not have immediate needs but will reach out later once they have something.  
* Over time, the number of inbound messages increases as your branding improves and more people check your profile after you connect.

---

### **Realistic outcomes over 30 days**

If you follow this playbook consistently, you can reasonably expect:

* 15–30 calls  
* Clear patterns in industry pain points  
* A repeatable outreach system  
* 1–3 paid projects  
* Long-term relationships with people who may hire you later  
* Increased confidence in positioning, messaging, and niche clarity

### **Follow-up strategy**

* Add warm conversations to a Sales Navigator custom list so you can track and revisit them without needing a separate CRM.  
* If someone mentioned a problem they’re working on, follow up in a few weeks with a simple “How’s it going with X?” to reopen the conversation naturally.  
* If they shared a challenge you can experiment with, do a quick demo or mini-prototype and send it over as a value-add (no pressure attached).  
* If the timing wasn’t right, circle back after 30–60 days with a short, friendly check-in — timing changes and projects evolve.  
* Stay top of mind by posting content on LinkedIn about the problems you’re hearing; they’ll see it and remember the call.  
* If someone showed interest but wasn’t ready, send them useful material related to their problem once in a while (articles, tools, examples).  
* When a pattern changes in the industry (new tool, update, regulation shift), use it as a reason to reach back out and provide insight.  
* For recruiters, check in monthly to stay on their radar since they constantly cycle through new openings and candidates.

---

### **Final tips**

* Outreach works best when you keep a steady daily rhythm because consistent momentum beats doing huge bursts and then stopping.  
* Treat outreach as a learning process, not a sales pitch, so conversations feel natural instead of forced.  
* Don’t wait for perfect positioning — start talking to people and let real problems guide your niche.  
* Keep your tone curious and helpful since people respond better to genuine interest than technical flexing.  
* Follow up lightly over time because many opportunities show up months after the first conversation.  
* Expect awkward calls in the beginning — outreach is a skill that improves quickly the more you practice.  
* Use Sales Navigator’s custom lead lists to track warm conversations so you can follow up later without needing a separate CRM.
