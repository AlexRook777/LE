# Image Prompts

Prompts for generating post visuals using AI image generation tools.

---

## Prompt Guidelines

- Images should look **professional and modern**, not stock-photo generic
- Use **dark mode aesthetics** — deep blues, blacks, with accent colors
- Include **data visualizations, diagrams, or abstract tech imagery** when appropriate
- **No text on images** — LinkedIn renders text poorly in image previews
- Target **1200×1200** or **1200×628** aspect ratios
