# Generate Ideas Workflow

## Steps

1. Read `.gemini.md` to refresh the content framework (Category × Perspective × Topic)
2. Review `content pipeline/5_published/` to identify topics already covered — **never duplicate**
3. Review `research/trending_topics.md` for current trends
4. Review `research/pain_points.md` for real audience problems
5. Review `content pipeline/1_ideas/` for existing ideas to avoid duplication
6. Generate 3-5 new post ideas using the 3-axis formula:
   - Mix categories: prioritize Educate, but include at least one other category
   - Vary perspectives: alternate between Expert, General, and Personal Story
   - Anchor all topics to AI + business process optimization
7. For each idea, include:
   - Title
   - Category × Perspective
   - Topic / sub-topic
   - Hook concept (one bold line)
   - Key insight / value payoff
   - Source of inspiration
8. Save ideas as individual `.md` files in `content pipeline/1_ideas/` with naming format:
   `YYYY-MM-DD_short-title.md`
9. Present the ideas to the user for feedback
