# Generate Ideas Workflow

## Steps

1. Read `.gemini.md` to refresh the content framework (Category × Perspective × Topic)
2. **Read `my projects/project_insights_extraction.md`** to review:
   - 5 key content themes from completed AI projects
   - Story arcs (Transformation, Technical Deep Dive, Lesson Learned, How-To)
   - Content hooks library (problem-focused, metric-focused, contrarian, how-to)
   - Metrics bank (70-85% automation, 3-4 integrations/day, etc.)
3. **Read `my projects/workflow_integration_guide.md`** for ready-to-use content ideas and template mappings
4. Review `content pipeline/4_published/` to identify topics already covered — **never duplicate**
5. Review `research/trending_topics.md` for current trends
6. Review `research/pain_points.md` for real audience problems
7. Review `research/viral_posts.md` for proven viral post structures from competitors
8. Review `content pipeline/1_ideas/` for existing ideas to avoid duplication
9. Generate 3-5 new post ideas using the 3-axis formula:
   - Mix categories: prioritize Educate, but include at least one other category
   - Vary perspectives: alternate between Expert, General, and Personal Story
   - Anchor all topics to AI + business process optimization
   - **Leverage project insights**: Use specific projects (PRD Assistant, Argus, OCR) as source material
   - **Apply story arcs**: Choose from Transformation, Technical Deep Dive, Lesson Learned, or How-To
   - **Use content hooks**: Reference the hooks library for compelling opening lines
10. For each idea, include:
    - Title
    - Category × Perspective
    - Topic / sub-topic
    - Hook concept (one bold line) — **use hooks from project insights when applicable**
    - Key insight / value payoff — **include specific metrics when relevant**
    - Source of inspiration (competitor research OR specific project from portfolio)
    - **[NEW] Source project** (if applicable): PRD Assistant / Argus / OCR Microservice
    - **[NEW] Target audience**: Technical Decision Makers / AI Engineers / Business Leaders / Process Optimizers
11. Save ideas as individual `.md` files in `content pipeline/1_ideas/` with naming format:
    `YYYY-MM-DD_short-title.md`
12. Present the ideas to the user for feedback
