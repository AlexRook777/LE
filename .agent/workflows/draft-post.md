# Draft Post Workflow

## Steps

1. Read `.gemini.md` to refresh post anatomy rules and tone/voice guide
2. Read `templates/post_templates.md` to select the best matching template
3. Read the idea file from `content pipeline/1_ideas/`
4. Start writing the draft in this order:
   - **Value payoff first** — what's the core insight or lesson?
   - **Story / body** — a quick personal moment or real example making it relatable
   - **Hook last** — one bold, clear line that stops the scroll
   - **CTA** — a soft call to action (question, invitation to discuss)
   - **Hashtags** — 5-10 relevant hashtags after a separator
5. Apply style rules:
   - Maximum ≤ 3000 symbols (LinkedIn limit), recommended 800–1500 for engagement
   - Emojis: sparingly, for visual breaks only
   - No fluff — if a sentence doesn't add value, cut it
   - Tone: direct, outcome-focused, data-backed, accessible
6. Save the draft to `content pipeline/2_drafts/` with the same filename as the idea
7. If a visual would help the post, note the image concept in the draft file under a `## Visual` section
8. Present the draft to the user for feedback
