# Research Competitors Workflow

## Steps

1. Read `research/competitor_profiles.md` for existing analyses
2. Navigate to LinkedIn and find profiles matching these criteria:
   - 10k+ followers
   - In the AI / automation / consulting / business process optimization space
   - Active poster (at least 1 post per week)
3. For each profile, analyze:
   - **Headline** — how they position themselves
   - **Banner** — visual branding
   - **Featured section** — what they highlight
   - **CTAs** — how they drive action
   - **Website / funnel** — where they send traffic
4. For each profile, find the **5 most viral posts** (highest engagement) and analyze:
   - **Hook** — what makes the first line compelling
   - **Structure** — how the post is organized
   - **Topic** — what subject matter resonated
   - **Media** — what visuals were used
   - **Comments pattern** — what kind of discussion it generated
5. Record findings in `research/competitor_profiles.md` and `research/viral_posts.md`
6. Extract 3-5 **replicable patterns** that can be applied to our content
7. Present findings to the user with actionable recommendations
