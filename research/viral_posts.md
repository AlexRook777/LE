## Posts

### The "3 Alarms" System
- **Author:** Eric Partaker
- **Category:** Inspire / Educate
- **Hook:** "I set 3 alarms on my phone every day. They changed my life." (Reconstructed)
- **Structure:** 
    1. The Hook (The weird habit)
    2. The Problem (Drifting through the day, losing focus)
    3. The Solution (The 3 Alarms: 6:30am World Fitness Champion, 9am World's Best Coach, 6:30pm World's Best Dad)
    4. The Science/Psychology (Identity-based change)
    5. CTA (Try it for a week)
- **Why it worked:** High curiosity gap ("Why 3 alarms?"). Simple, actionable, and addresses the universal pain of "work-life balance" without using the cliché. It gives a concrete identity to each part of the day.
- **Applicable pattern:** **The "Daily Ritual" Framework.** Share a specific, slightly unusual personal habit that solves a major universal problem (burnout/focus).

### The "Feature Factory" Trap
- **Author:** Dr. Bart Jaworski
- **Category:** Educate / Convince
- **Hook:** "Are you working in a Feature Factory? Here are 8 signs."
- **Structure:**
    1. Hook (The labels/fear factor)
    2. Definition (What is a feature factory?)
    3. The List (Sign 1, Sign 2... e.g., "Celebrates shipping, not outcomes")
    4. The Impact (Why this destroys your career)
    5. CTA (Share if you've seen this)
- **Why it worked:** Validates the frustration of thousands of PMs. Gives a "name" to their pain. High shareability because people want to signal "I know this is bad, I'm smart."
- **Applicable pattern:** **The "Diagnosis" Listicle.** Identify a common painful situation, name it, and list the symptoms. Let people self-diagnose.

### Untrapping Product Teams (Bullshit Management)
- **Author:** David Pereira
- **Category:** Convince / Entertain
- **Hook:** "Stop managing people. Start managing value." / "Most 'Agile' is just Bullshit Management in disguise."
- **Structure:**
    1. Contrarian Statement (Agile isn't working)
    2. The Reality (We just added meetings to waterfalls)
    3. The "Untrapped" Way (Focus on value, autonomy)
    4. Visual (Simple diagram comparing "BS Management" vs "Value Creation")
- **Why it worked:** Anger/Relief. PMs feel bogged down by process. Calling it "Bullshit" cuts through the noise and aligns with their inner frustration.
- **Applicable pattern:** **The "Enemy" Narrative.** Identify a widely accepted practice (e.g., rigid Agile, excessive meetings) and label it as the enemy of real work.

### The AI Productivity Paradox ("Workslop")
- **Author:** Gregory Khropot (Theme analysis)
- **Category:** Educate
- **Hook:** "Companies are spending millions on AI. Productivity isn't moving. Why?"
- **Structure:**
    1. The Data Point (Investment is up, P&L impact is flat)
    2. The Concept ("Workslop" - spending time managing AI instead of doing work)
    3. The Root Cause (Lack of workflow integration)
    4. The Solution (AI Native vs AI Added)
- **Why it worked:** Intellectual validation for skeptics and frustrated adopters. Introduces a sticky term ("Workslop") to describe a feeling.
- **Applicable pattern:** **The "Counter-Intuitive" Insight.** Take a hype train (AI is amazing) and show why it's failing in the real world (The Paradox), then offer the "Real" fix.

### Hard Skills > Soft Skills
- **Author:** Andrii Mandrika (Theme analysis)
- **Category:** Educate
- **Hook:** "Stop obsessing over 'influence'. If you can't read a P&L, you're not a PM."
- **Structure:**
    1. The Challenge (Everyone talks about soft skills)
    2. The Hard Truth (Soft skills don't save bad products)
    3. The List (SQL, Unit Economics, Roadmapping, Data Analysis)
    4. CTA (Which one are you missing?)
- **Why it worked:** Counter-culture. LinkedIn is flooded with "soft skills" fluff. This appeals to the desire for concrete competence and gatekeeping entry-level quality.
- **Applicable pattern:** **The "Hard Truth" Pivot.** Challenge the "feel-good" consensus with a "succeed-hard" reality check.

### Street Smart MVP
- **Author:** Shardul Mehta
- **Category:** Educate
- **Hook:** "Your MVP is too big. Here is how to actually validate."
- **Structure:**
    1. The Mistake (Building a product)
    2. The Street Smart Way (Sell a PDF, a spreadsheet, a consultation)
    3. Personal Story (How I validated X with $0)
    4. The Lesson (Revenue fluency > Feature fluency)
- **Why it worked:** Practicality. "Street Smart" implies savvy, low-cost, high-return. It appeals to the entrepreneurial spirit.
- **Applicable pattern:** **The "Zero-to-One" How-To.** Show exactly how to do something complicated (validation) in a scrappy, "street smart" way.
